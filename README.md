# Store-Item-Demand-Forecasting
Kaggle Competition for Advanced Predictive Modeling

Our idea was to explore different time series techniques. We found a dataset on Kaggle with 5 years of store-item sales data. Our task is to predict sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores while taking into account seasonality. Various models (ARMA, ARIMA, LGBM, XGBoost, Prophet)  are explored to understand aspects of time series analysis and forecasting.
